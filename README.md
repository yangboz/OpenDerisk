### Features
1. **DeepResearch RCA:** Quickly locate the root cause of issues through in-depth analysis of logs, traces, and code.
2. **Visualized Evidence Chain:** Fully visualize the diagnostic process and evidence chain, making the diagnosis clear and enabling quick judgment of accuracy.
3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Collaboration among SRE-Agent, Code-Agent, ReportAgent, Vis-Agent, and Data-Agent.
4. **Open and Open-Source Architecture:** OpenDeRisk is built with a completely open and open-source architecture, allowing related frameworks and code to be used out of the box in open-source projects.

### Architure
<p align="left">

</p>

The system adopts a multi-agent architecture. Currently, the code mainly implements the green-highlighted parts. Alert awareness is based on Microsoft's open-source [OpenRCA dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenRCA). The dataset size is approximately 26GB after decompression. On this dataset, we achieve root cause analysis and diagnosis through multi-agent collaboration, where the Code-Agent dynamically writes code for final analysis.

#### Technical Implementation
**Data Layer:** Pull the large-scale OpenRCA dataset (20GB) from GitHub, decompress it locally, and process it for analysis.

**Logic Layer:** Multi-agent architecture, with collaboration among SRE-Agent, Code-Agent, ReportAgent, Vis-Agent, and Data-Agent to perform in-depth DeepResearch RCA (Root Cause Analysis).

**Visualization Layer:** Use the Vis protocol to dynamically render the entire processing flow and evidence chain, as well as the process of multi-role collaboration and switching.

### Quick Start

Install uv

```python
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

####  Install Packages

```
uv sync derisk --frozen \
uv sync derisk-core --frozen \
uv sync derisk-ext --frozen \
uv sync derisk-client --frozen \
--extra "base" \
--extra "proxy_openai" \
--extra "rag" \
--extra "storage_chromadb" \
--extra "client"
```

#### Start

Configure the API_KEY in the derisk-proxy-deepseek.toml file, then run the following command to start.


> Note: By default, we use the Telecom dataset from the OpenRCA dataset. You can download it via the link or the following command:

> gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1cyOKpqyAP4fy-QiJ6a_cKuwR7D46zyVe

After downloading, modify the dataset path in the file [basic_prompt_Telecom.py](https://github.com/derisk-ai/OpenDerisk/blob/main/packages/derisk-ext/src/derisk_ext/ai_sre/resource/basic_prompt_Telecom.py) to the local absolute path.


Run the startup command:
```
uv run python packages/derisk-app/src/derisk_app/derisk_server.py --config configs/derisk-proxy-deepseek.toml
```
